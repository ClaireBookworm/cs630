You can run the tailwind parts with `npx tailwindcss -i ./styles/globals.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch ` (not exactly sure why it also needs to me run) alongside `npm run dev`. 

Feel free to add your `.md` files into the `posts` folder! Add the title using the same format as this:

```md
---
title: "Title here"
chapter: "1.1"
---
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
